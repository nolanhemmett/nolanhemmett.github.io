      <description>As far as crazy seasons go, FC Barcelona in La Liga have had a rollercoaster of a 2021/22 season. It all started with rumors of Lionel Messi being linked with a move to Paris Saint-Germain F.C in France.
Messi sprouted in Barcelonaâ€™s club academy and has spent his entire career in Barcelona, so no one saw it coming when the rumor was true and just like that the backbone of Barcelona for 21 years was gone.</description>

      <description>The last time Lazio won the title in Serie A was in 2000. Since then, the club has always been a solid top 10 squad in Italy. Their highest finish since the title win was in 2015, where they finished third on the table.
Currently, Lazio is 6th on the table. A win against Sassuolo on April 2nd put them two points behind Roma. The club is looking to push past Roma to get into the Europa League for next year.</description>
