      <description>The last time Lazio won the title in Serie A was in 2000. Since then, the club has always been a solid top 10 squad in Italy. Their highest finish since the title win was in 2015, where they finished third on the table.
Currently, Lazio is 6th on the table. A win against Sassuolo on April 2nd put them two points behind Roma. The club is looking to push past Roma to get into the Europa League for next year.</description>
